		 *
		 * @details
		 * This macro determines how long the TWI controller waits for bus activity before declaring a time-out condition.
		 *
		 * The value can be set to predefined time-out codes:
		 * - `TWI_TIMEOUT_DISABLED_gc`: Bus time-out disabled (default). Time-out detection is turned off.
		 * - `TWI_TIMEOUT_50US_gc`: Bus time-out after 50 �s (SMBus, baud assumed at 100 kHz).
		 * - `TWI_TIMEOUT_100US_gc`: Bus time-out after 100 �s (baud assumed at 100 kHz).
		 * - `TWI_TIMEOUT_200US_gc`: Bus time-out after 200 �s (baud assumed at 100 kHz).
		 *
		 * Setting the inactive bus time-out (TIMEOUT) will enable the inactive bus time-out supervisor. If the bus is inactive for longer than the TIMEOUT setting, the bus state logic will enter the Idle state.
